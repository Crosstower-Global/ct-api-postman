# Crosstower API Postman
[Postman](https://getpostman.com) is an API Collaboration Platform.

Crosstower now offers Postman Collections and Environments (JSON files) for a quicker and easier integration.<br/>
You only need to import and set up with your own API and secret keys to begin.

## How to import and configure
- Download the `ct-apis-postman` repository.

- Click the `Import` button. On Postman for Mac, for example, the button is at the top left:
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/1.png" alt="Screenshot of Postman for Mac, with 'Import' button pointed out at top left."/></p>

- On the `Import` pop-up page, select the `Folder` tab. Click the `Choose folder from your computer` button and choose the root folder of the downloaded repository.

- Select which collections and environments you would like to import and click the `Import` button.

- Select the `Environments` tab on the left, choose an environment, and set your Api Key and Api Secret by changing the `Current Value` column (see screenshot);
(The `checksum` field can be left empty as itâ€™ll be automatically filled by Postman when sending a request.)

- Select your newly-added environment from the environment dropdown menu. On Mac, this is at top right, to the left of the eye icon.

## Postman safety practices
The following practices are advised to secure your account's safety:

- Don't use Collections obtained from an unknown source.
- Review the environment JSON file before its usage.
- Don't use any code that you don't understand.


## FAQ
**Q:** Why I can't get any response?

You haven't imported the environment file or you've imported it but haven't selected it from the dropdown menu (mentioned in [[How to import and configure]])

**Q:** How can I debug a request or find the used URL?

- Open the Postman's console to find requests' parameters and URL.
- Debugging can be done by editing the `Pre-request Script` tab.

**Q:** Error `Invalid merchant api key`

Likely causes:
- API key is not set.
- API key is not correct.
- `X-CTI-APIKEY` is not selected in your Postman `Headers` tab.

**Q:** Error `Invalid checksum`

Likely causes:
- Secret key is not set.
- Request was made with at least one empty parameter.
- `checksum` is not selected in your Postman `Headers` tab.

**Q:** Error `Mandatory parameter 'xxxx' was not sent, was empty/null, or malformed.`

Please refer to the API documentation to double check all the mandatory parameters.
